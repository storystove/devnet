  // ========================================================================
  // IF YOU REPLACE THIS WITH ACTUAL GOOGLE DRIVE API CALLS:
  // Your Google Drive API key (e.g., "AIzaSy...") would typically be used
  // when constructing requests to the Google Drive API.
  // For example, it might be included as a query parameter in the API URL:
  // const apiUrl = `https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/files?uploadType=media&key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`;
  // Or, depending on the specific Google Drive client library or method,
  // it might be part of an initialization config or request headers.
  //
  // !!! CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING !!!
  // Exposing an API key with write access to your Google Drive directly in
  // client-side JavaScript is highly insecure and strongly discouraged.
  // This can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of your Google Drive.
  // Consider using a secure backend (like Firebase Cloud Functions) to
  // handle Google Drive API interactions, or use Firebase Storage which is
  // designed for secure client-side uploads in Firebase applications.
